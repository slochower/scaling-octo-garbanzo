The experimental and theoretical labs at Yale provide exceptional opportunities for collaboration on research projects in chemistry, including the proposed work. My research goals for large-scale membrane simulations are aligned with the vesicle budding and fusion work of Rothman and Chui-Ying Yan as well as the super-resolution intracellular imaging of Schepartz. I would value the opportunity to work with Batista, Vaccaro, and Wang, on the photochemistry of overcrowded alkenes. Finally, my work on force field development is both complementary to, and synergistic with, the many contributions of Jorgensen.
