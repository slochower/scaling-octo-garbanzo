The interface between physics and biology is an active, growing area of science with many unanswered questions.
I plan to focus on three areas that bridge theory, modeling, and simulations.
My research program will investigate the physical principles that underlie biological and chemical phenomena, providing new insight into the complex behavior of cell membranes, the operation of molecular motors, and more rigorous methods of developing force fields. 
I will extend my previous work in single molecule biophysics and elucidate the driving forces that govern the stability of sub-micron clusters featuring phosphoinositides. 
I seek to use nonequilibrium kinetic modeling to develop a theory governing the physics of artificial molecular motors and clarify design principles that can be used to build the next generation of nanomachines.
Finally, I will help systematically overhaul force field science, changing the way force fields are built and how they are distributed, by focusing on transparent and rigorous optimization criteria, in an open setting.
