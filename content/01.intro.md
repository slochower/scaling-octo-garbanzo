My research interests center on uncovering the physical principles that underlie biological and chemical phenomena. 
I try to create more accurate molecular simulations by improving physics-based force fields and combining new simulation procedures with nonequilibrium analytical tools.
I will extend my previous work on biological membranes to elucidate driving forces behind the formation of membrane domains featuring phosphoinositides.
I will also run simulations of synthetic molecular motors, such as those designed by Ben Feringa, to characterize their mechanical properties.
Finally, I will participate in a systematic overhaul of force field science, changing the way force fields are built and how they are distributed, by focusing on transparent and rigorous optimization criteria, in an open setting.
These investigations will provide a detailed accounting of the physical principles that are at work in biological systems.
My undergraduate degree in physics combined with my graduate work in biochemistry and biophysics, together with my postdoctoral training in computational chemistry, makes me well suited to this research plan.
Each aim of my detailed research plan focuses on a physical or chemical question at the heart of molecular motion.

**Insert university-specific paragraph here.** At Carnegie Mellon, I look forward to extending my research on membranes using coarse-grained models,
