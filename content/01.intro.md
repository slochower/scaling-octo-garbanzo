The interface between physics and biology is an active, growing area of science with many opportunities and unanswered questions.
I plan to focus on three areas that bridge theory, modeling, and simulations.
My research program will investigate the physical principles that underlie biological and chemical phenomena, providing new insight into the complex behavior of cell membranes and the operation and design of molecular motors.
In parallel, I will develop advanced simulation technologies to compute binding free energies and improve force fields, continuing my commitment to open source software and open access science.
