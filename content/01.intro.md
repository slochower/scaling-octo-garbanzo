The interface between physics and biology is an active, growing area of science with many opportunities and unanswered questions.
I plan to focus on three areas that bridge theory, modeling, and simulations.
My research program will investigate physical principles that underlie biological and chemical phenomena, providing new insight into the complex behavior of cell membranes and the operation and design of molecular motors.
In parallel, I will develop advanced simulation technologies centered on accurate calculations of noncovalent binding free energies and improvement of simulation force fields.
