The interface between physics and biology is an active, growing area of science with many unanswered questions. 
My research program will investigate the physical principles that underlie biological and chemical phenomena, providing new insight into the complex behavior of cell membranes, the operation of molecular motors, and more rigorous methods of developing force fields. 
In particular, I will focus on three areas that bridge theory, modeling, and simulations: (1) the formation of ion-mediated phospholipid domains, (2) the out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics of synthetic rotary motors, and (3) open source development of new force fields for drug design incorporating binding thermodynamics.

Method development is vital to my research interests because it allows theory and simulation to gain new perspectives on challenging problems. 
I will extend my previous work on biological membranes to elucidate the driving forces behind  clusters featuring phosphoinositides. 
I will use nonequilibrium kinetic modeling to suggest new design principles for molecular motors.
Finally, I will participate in a systematic overhaul of force field science, changing the way force fields are built and how they are distributed, by focusing on transparent and rigorous optimization criteria, in an open setting.
