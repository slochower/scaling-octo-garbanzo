# Determine the mechanism by which highly enriched PtdIns*P*~2~ domains are stabilized

Recent studies have shown that submicron domains of PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ exist *in vivo* at physiological levels of monovalent and divalent cations.

These clusters reach a stable size around 80 nm. 

PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ caries a large negative charge.

We have shown that Ca^2+^ is able to stabilize these clusters, in a limited fashion.

We have recently shown how Ca^2+^ can initiate the formation of clusters, however, it is not clear how clustesrs grow until they reach ~ 80 nm.
