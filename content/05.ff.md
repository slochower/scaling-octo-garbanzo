## Can we build a truly open force field?
In this aim, I test the hypothesis that all-atom molecular dynamics force fields for small molecules (e.g., the general AMBER force field, GAFF[@doi:10.1002/jcc.20035]) can be improved by incorporating host-guest binding data in their parameterization. 
Many small molecule force fields have been parameterized against the properties of pure liquids, such as heats of vaporization and density.
Although force fields such as GAFF are able to reproduce some equilibrium thermodynamic properties well, they have notable failures [@doi:10.1101/286542] and perform only moderately well for predicting binding free energies and enthalpies [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00359].

### Incorporate host-guest binding data into force field development

We will also investigate end-state methods, such as interaction entropy

The partial derivatives can be used to linearly extrapolate.

Cyclodextrins only have three functional groups, but through selective syntehsis, we can test more.

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\partial (\partial G_\text{SEM})}{\partial (dU/d\lambda_\text{SEM})} \frac{\partial (dU/d\lambda_\text{SEM})}{\partial N_\text{frames}}
$$ {#eq:roi}

Equation @eq:roi is the return on investment.
