## Can we build a truly open force field?
In this aim, I test the hypothesis that all-atom molecular dynamics force fields for small molecules (e.g., the general AMBER force field, GAFF[@doi:10.1002/jcc.20035]) can be improved by incorporating host-guest binding data in their parameterization. 
Many common force fields to date have been parameterized against the properties of pure liquids, such as enthalpy of vaporization and density.
Although force fields such as GAFF are able to reproduce some equilibrium thermodynamic properties well, they have notable failures [@doi:10.1101/286542] and perform only moderately well for predicting binding free energies and enthalpies [@doi:10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00359].

### Incorporate host-guest binding data into force field development

### Integrate automated optimization techniques, such as ForceBalance, with host-guest binding data
