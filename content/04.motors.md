As demonstrated by Richard Feynman in a lecture on Brownian ratchets, the challenge of designing molecular motors is not how to create movement, but how to control the directionality of the omnipresent -- and random -- motion on the molecular scale [@doi:10.1038/nnano.2006.45].
Non-protein synthetic molecules can be used to drive molecular motion and have been employed as "wheels" on nano-scale cars [@doi:10.1038/nature10587], trains [@doi:10.1007/s12274-008-8041-4], worms [@doi:10.1021/ol703027h], and walkers [@doi:10.1039/c1cs15005g], or in new forms of responsive materials [@doi:10.1039/B101231M].
Yet, the design of these machines has mostly consisted of trial and error and it is not clear *a priori* how chemically modifying their scaffolds affects their functioning  [@doi:10.1039/c7cs00245a].

One the best studied groups of molecular machines is the “second generation” rotary motors from Ben Feringa and colleagues [@doi:10.1002/chem.200800969].
These overcrowded alkenes have two stable enantiomers, and adopt a helical shape due to the steric strain around the central double bond (Figure @fig:motor-diagram).
Upon irradiation with light and the application of heat, the two sets of conjugated rings rotate relative to each other, with the central bond acting as an axle, and for simplicity, one set of rings is designated the "stator" while the other set is called the "rotor."
The directional motion of these molecules can be analyzed in terms of two degrees of freedom: $E$ to $Z$ for the isomerization of the double bond (analogous to *cis* and *trans*) and $P$ and $M$ for the overall twist or helicity of the molecule.

Over the past decade, there have been many designs for rotary motors (reviewed by Kassem et al.[@doi:10.1039/c7cs00245a]), and it has become clear that the chemical constituents on both the rotor and the stator affect motor operation [@doi:10.1021/jo500411z] (Figure @fig:feringa-r).
Reducing the bulkiness of the rotor can speed up the overall rotation rate of the motor, but can also lead to the loss of directionality [@doi:10.1021/ja036782o].
It is also possible to alter the quantum yield of the photochemical step by adding electron withdrawing or electron donating groups, polarizing the molecule and lengthening the central double bond [@doi:10.1021/jo5004289; @doi:10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b02575].
Yet, to date there is no underlying theory that can be leveraged to aid the creation of new motors.

Considerable effort has been spent using advanced quantum mechanical modeling to investigate the photochemical excitation and the dynamics of the excited state [@doi:10.1021/ct200199w; @doi:10.1021/jp100609m].
However, those insights have not been fully integrated with statistical mechanics to provide a comprehensive picture of how the excited state connects with the four ground states that comprise the 360$^\circ$ cycle of the motor (Figure @fig:motors, left side) to generate directed motion.
My approach to modeling involves adapting the nonequilibrium method I have already developed to analyze directional motion in biological motors. 
The ground state structures can be mapped onto discretized potential energy surfaces (PES) for each isomerization state, that will be determined evaluating the ground state energy of the motor as a function of the central dihedral angle (Figure @fig:motors, right side).
A Markov matrix encodes the rates of moving between and along bins on each PES, and the eigenvectors of this matrix characterize the steady state probability flux that quantifies the extent of directional motion.
From this, I can determine the maximum speed and the maximum power that can be produced by individual motors.

A clone of the lower $E$ energy surface is shown above, for clarity, to demonstrate the progression from state 4 to state 1 requires energy.](images/offset-barriers.png){#fig:motors width=100%}

The kinetic model allows me to go beyond the characterization of existing motors.
By systematically studying how the addition of chemical moieties affects the $E$ and $Z$ PES of the motors, the relationship between the chemical makeup of the rotor and stator and the strength of directional motion will become clear.
The understanding gained from this analysis can be used to suggest new avenues in chemical space to create rotors geared for a particular purpose.
For example, in some instances it may be desirable to have motors that rotate slowly but provide a tremendous amount of torque (e.g., for using nanoscale motors to transport macroscopic objects) while in other circumstances, it may be more beneficial to have motors that rotate as quickly as possible (e.g., for using motors to rapidly switch the surface properties of a particular material). 
The results of this research will provide a fundamental understanding of the principles underlying motor operation and open up rational design for molecular rotors, pumps, transporters, and other nanorobotics.
