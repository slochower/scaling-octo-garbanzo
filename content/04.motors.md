## What are the mechanical properties of synthetic molecular motors?
The ability of light-driven molecular motors to switch between two or more states makes them suitable for new forms of optical data storage [@doi:10.1007/s003390201338], as "wheels" on nano-scale cars [@doi:10.1038/nature10587], trains [@doi:10.1007/s12274-008-8041-4], worms [@doi:10.1021/ol703027h], and walkers [@doi:10.1039/c1cs15005g], or in new forms of responsive materials [@doi:10.1039/B101231M].
Unlike switches, whose work is reversed after every full cycle, molecular motors can be used to progressively move systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium [@doi:10.1039/c7cs00245a].
The synthetic molecular motors of Ben Fergina operate by converting light and heat into directional rotary motion.
These motors belong to a class of molecules called overcrowded alkenes, with two stable enantiomers, and adopt a helical shape due to steric strain around the central double bond.
The two sets of conjugated rings rotate relative to each other, with the central bond acting as an axle, and for simplicity, one set of rings is designated the "stator" while the other set is called the "rotor."
The directional motion of these molecules can be analyzed in terms of two degrees of freedom: $E$ to $Z$ for the isomerization of the double bond (analogous to *cis* and *trans*) and $P$ and $M$ for the overall twist or helicity of the molecule (Figure @fig:motor-diagram).

### Calculate the speed, torque, and efficiency of motors
In 2006, it was shown that light driven molecular motors can rotate a glass rod that is more than 10,000 times their size upon irradiation with light and when included as a dopant in a liquid crystal film [@doi:10.1038/440163a].
While it is clear that artificial motors, when aligned appropriately so their individual effects are magnified, can produce macroscopic effects, it is not known how much force an individual molecular motor can generate. 
I will use the nonequilibrium model I developed to quantify directional motion in biological motors with these artificial molecular motors.
 I will focus on the “second generation” class of motors from Ben Feringa and colleagues, which possess symmetric stators that enable easier functionalization, and a lower energy cost for the thermal helix inversion step.
 I will study the four ground states that comprise the 360 degree cycle depicted in Figure @fig:motors.
 On the left, the four structural states of the motor demonstrate movement of the upper rotor relative to the fixed stator through two photochemical and two thermal steps.
 On the right, the free energy profiles along a given surface $E$ or $Z$ represent the pattern of energy troughs and barriers for changing the helicity of the structure while maintaining the same orientation of the double bond, essentially sliding the bulky biaryl rings connected to the rotor past the stator.
 This barrier can be considerable, on the order of tens to hundreds of kcal/mol, depending on the chemical groups attached to the rotor.
 Each ground state can have a half life of months to years at room temperature [@doi:10.1039/c7cs00245a].
 The excited state structures and dynamics are considerably more complex and, based on preliminary work in the Gilson group, are difficult to converge.

On the right, the same four states placed on free energy profiles. The energy profiles are periodic, with two cycles shown for both isomerization state. A clone of the lower $E$ energy surface is shown above, for clarity, to demonstrate the progression from state 4 to state 1 requires energy.](images/offset-barriers.png){#fig:motors width=100%}
 
 To run the nonequilibrium model, we need to know the shape of the energy surfaces and the rate constants for moving between and along each surface. 
 The free energy profiles along a given surface represent the energy barrier for the changing the helicity of the structure while maintaining the same orientation of the double bond. 
 Previously we used microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations to determine the energy landscapes based on equilibrium population distributions.
 However, because the barriers here are expected to be much larger, I will directly probe the potential surfaces by evaluating the energy of conformations for different values of the central dihedral angle.
 I will perform this dihedral scan using a quantum chemistry package, such as [Psi4](http://psicode.org/) using density functional theory and semi-empirical methods.
 B3LYP calculations with the 6-31G* basis set were used to optimize the geometry of a related motor and then subjected to surface scanning using PM3 semi-empirical methods [@doi:10.1021/jp100609m].
 I will begin using those methods and move to higher level basis sets and higher levels of theory if necessary.
 I will test the sensitivity of these results to different quantum methods.

I expect there to be a small but nonzero energy gap between the surfaces due to the chirality of the molecule.
Although the motion from $3 \rightarrow 4$ is the reverse of $1 \rightarrow 2$, there are small differences in the maximum wavelength used to achieve the transformations.
A difference in the relative stability of each isomer has also been detected through proton NMR.
The quantum calculations will reveal the difference between the two conformers for a specific helicity, and this will be used to offset the surfaces in the nonequilibrium model.

### Optimize the design of artificial molecular motors
As demonstrated by Richard Feynman in a lecture on Brownian ratchets, the challenge of designing molecular motors is not how to create motion, but how to control the directionality of the omnipresent motion on the molecular scale [@doi:10.1038/nnano.2006.45].
This is the so-called “gating" of stochastic motion[@doi:10.1039/c7cc06683j].
In my previous work [@doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2018.02.008], I showed that the gating can arise purely from the complementary shape of two potential energy surfaces, whereby an unpassable barrier on one surface can be bypassed through motion on the other surface (see Figure S6, in particular.)
In this section, I will explore the relationship between the shape of the potential energy surfaces the directionality of artificial molecular motors.

Using numerical methods such as gradient descent and COBYLA (where the derivative of the function is not known or expensive to compute), I will optimize the potential energy surfaces to yield the maximum directional flux and maximum torque generated. 
The surfaces will be modeled as splines with six to eight control points evenly spaced out along the periodic degree of freedom and the spline points will be allowed to move as the optimization procedure runs. 
Based on preliminary work using analytical functions as the potential energy surfaces, this procedure affords ample room to significantly change the properties of the surfaces. Indeed, some perturbations have reversed the flux on a given surface. 

I will begin using steepest descent and gradient based methods to optimize the potential energy surfaces to yield the maximal directional flux and maximum torque generated.
If those methods fail, I will use a method that does not rely on the gradient, such as constrained optimization by linear approximation (COBYLA).
The surfaces will be modeled as splines with six to eight control points evenly spaced out along the periodic degree of freedom and the spline points will be allowed to move as the optimization procedure runs. 
Based on preliminary work using analytical functions as the potential energy surfaces, this procedure affords ample room to significantly change the properties of the surfaces. 
Indeed, some perturbations have reversed the flux on a given surface. 

Next, I will couple my understanding of the surfaces with knowledge of how chemical constituents affect overall rotation rates to suggest new designs for synthetic motors.
