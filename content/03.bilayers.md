## Use simulations to understand lipid dynamics in cell membranes
*The goal of this aim is to deepen our understanding of
lipid-lipid interactions, the physical mechanisms that drive and stabilize lateral segregation of lipid species, and the functional consequences for the cell of these physical phenomena.*

The primary function of the cell membrane is to separate what is inside from what is outside, but membranes play many additional roles and have complex structural properteis. For example, they act as scaffolds for the generation of second messengers and as an attachment point for the cytoskeleton, and they form highly curved geometries during vesicle fusion and fission, among myriad other functions.
Mammalian plasma membranes are a rich mixture of hundreds of types of phospholipids intermingled with other types of lipids, sterols, and proteins.
Continuum models have shed light on membrane topology and geometry, but cannot capture all the intricacies of lipid-lipid interactions believed to be biologically relevant  [@doi:10.1088/1361-6463/aacb98].
All-atom simulations provide far more detail, but until recently [@doi:10.1021/ja507832e], have typically incorporated only a few lipid types and thus have not addressed the full complexity of these systems.

Despite advances in super-resolution microscopy, such as PALM [@doi:10.1126/science.1127344] and STORM [@doi:10.1038/nmeth929], *in vivo* characterization of membrane heterogeneity remains challenging, due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required to study fluctuating nanoscale assemblies and the need to chemically modify the lipids in order to directly probe their motions and conformations by spectroscopy. 
However, a variety of indirect experimental techniques, often using fluorescently labeled lipid analogs, have demonstrated and characterized the existence of submicron-scale lipid domains in living cells and plasma membrane extracts [@doi:10.1021/bi010496c; @doi:10.1529/biophysj.105.070839; @doi:10.1042/BJ20091283; @doi:10.1529/biophysj.106.094730; @doi:10.1073/pnas.0611357104].
Even in the absence of proteins or chemical modifications, *in vitro* assays in the Janmey group have demonstrated clusters of negatively charged phospholipids of on the order of 50 nm after the addition of as little as 1 μM Ca^2+^ [@doi:10.1021/ja208640t].
It is believed that such domains *in vivo* serve as platforms for the initiation of signaling cascades, as the destination for membrane trafficking events, or act to recruit certain lipids and proteins [@doi:10.1126/science.1174621; @doi:10.1038/nrm.2017.16]. 

My goal is to understand what conditions promote cluster formation and how the behavior of lipids in clusters differs from bulk. 
I will initially focus on delineating the nucleation of cation-induced clusters of anionic phospholipids. 
This work will involve extending the methods I developed to investigate single molecule QM/MM and all-atom nanoscale simulations. 
In those simulations, I found that Ca^2+^ can act as "molecular glue," forming aggregates of three lipids that remain together for at least 100 ns, much longer than other ion-lipid bond lifetimes. 
Extending beyond the all-atom simulations, I will use the [methods](https://github.com/biophyscode) we created to construct and equilibrate multi-component membrane systems to build models containing rich mixtures of phospholipids (Figure @fig:membrane-setup), going past typical two or three-component systems that are frequently used.

The finite and well-defined size of the experimentally-characterized domains suggests there is a balance between the mutual electrostatic and steric repulsion of negatively charged lipids and attraction mediated by counterions. 
I will monitor the extent of phase separation and demixing in simulations containing combinations of physiological divalent and monovalent ions with varying fractions of charged and uncharged lipids. 
The calculated diffusion coefficient inside the clusters can be compared with values obtained using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and spot variant FCS [@doi:10.1042/BJ20091283].
Simple, physical models based primarily on electrostatics [@doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2011.09.039] predict continual growth of clusters in the presence of excess counterions, yet *in vivo* clusters plateau at a stable size.
Taking advantage of multiscale techniques, including all-atom and coarse-grained simulations using GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics, I will be able to study the growth and merging of clusters on the biologically-relevant microsecond to millisecond timescale. 
Agreement with experimental data from AFM imaging and electron microscopy will be checked [@doi:10.1021/ja208640t], while the simulations will provide atomistic details beyond those available from experiments.

Experiments pulling thin membrane tethers have shown that phase-separated phospholipid domains form precisely at the junction of highly curved regions [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0913997107], implying a relationship between membrane morphology and lipid sorting.
Free energy methods, such as those detailed in the [third aim](#build-advanced-technologies-to-perform-free-energy-calculations-for-drug-design) of this proposal, can be used to impose a given curvature on a region and measure the energy required to do so.
The bending modulus and mean curvature of simulated clusters will be compared with data from pipette aspiration of membrane tubules [@doi:10.1073/pnas.0913997107; @doi:10.1042/BJ20091283; @doi:10.1073/pnas.0611357104], and the order parameter of lipids inside the cluster can be contrasted with complementary non-fluorescent methods, such as  EPR, NMR, and neutron scattering.

In the second phase of this project, I will study whether being in a cluster alters the ability of certain lipids to perform their biological roles. 
Many of the lipids implicated in cluster formation, such as PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~, have been shown to bind hundreds of proteins [@doi:10.1038/nrm2328], and several integral membrane proteins have been shown to partition into lipid raft-like domains [@doi:10.1016/j.bbamem.2018.05.002].
In some cases, PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ binds protein pockets in a highly stereospecific manner (e.g., PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ may bind tightly but the closely related isomers PtdIns(3,4)*P*~2~ and PtdIns(3,5)*P*~2~ may not bind at all) requiring a fully extended and accessible head group (Figure @fig:stereospecific). 
In order to evaluate the biological consequences of clustering, I will run simulations containing proteins that bind through either non-specific, electrostatic attraction (e.g., N-WASP and gelsolin) or through tight coordination (e.g., the PH domain of PLCδ). 
Whether these proteins bind “free” lipid molecules as well as they bind clustered ones will be tested using enhanced sampling methods.

I expect the outcome of studying lipid sorting and segregation to be especially helpful for understanding how the accumulation of membrane components is coupled to the many dynamic biological roles of the plasma membrane.
In the near future, it may be possible to track and visualize multimeric assemblies of proteins and lipids using cryoelectron microscopy and relate how dysfunction in the assembly process, delineated in this aim, is linked to disease.
Furthermore, I anticipate the results in the second phase could provide quantitative insights for pore-formation in cell membranes by toxins and cationic surfactants, the activation of integral ion channels and GPCRs by certain lipids, and the energetics of membrane fusion, fission and other buckling geometries.
