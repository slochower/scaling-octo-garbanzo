# Detailed research plan

## How are highly enriched clusters of negatively charged phospholipids stabilized?

Phosphoinositides are a minor class of lipids located on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, found at about 0.5 mole percent of all phospholipids in mammalian cells (10-100 μM), that have an outsized biological role.
This class of lipids participates in myriad cell processes including attachment of the cytoskeleton, membrane fusion, vesiculation, and both activation and inhibition of enzymes [@doi:10.1038/nature05185].
Disruption in signaling pathways associated with the phosphoinositides have been implicated in several cancers as well as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease along with other neurodegenerative disorders [@tag:test; @tag:lin; @doi:10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.615; @doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-0653; @doi:10.1126/science.1135394; @doi:10.1038/nrc2842].
Among all phospholipids, PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ may be the most common regulatory lipid: hundreds of cytosolic proteins have been found to bind PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ in vitro [@doi:10.1038/nrm2328] including proteins that cause or sense membrane curvature [@doi:10.1146/annurev.biophys.31.082901.134259; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.11.1216].

PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ is one of the most highly charged molecules in the cell, carrying a net charge from -3 to -5 at physiologically pH, owing to a phosphodinoester and two phosphomonoester groups [@doi:10.1021/bi9008616].
Despite their high charge, through the use of super-resolution microscopy, there is mounting evidence for nano-scale clusters of PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ within cells. 
In neuronal cells, clusters of PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ have been visualized using fluorescent phosphoinositide-binding domains and phosphoinositide-specific antibodies [@doi:10.1038/nature10545.; @doi:10.1038/nsmb.2570].
These clusters are circular, roughly 70--90 nm in diameter, and composed of greater than 80% PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~. 
A separate study found clusters of around 60 nm for PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~, and larger clusters for PtdIns(3,4,5)*P*~3~, in the plasma membrane [@doi:10.1242/bio.20122071]. 
Even in the absence of proteins, *in vitro* assays in the Janmey group have demonstrated PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ clusters of 40--50 nm, by AFM and TEM imaging, after the addition of as little as ~1  μM Ca^2+^[@doi:10.1021/ja208640t].
Another study using fluorescence self-quenching and Förster resonance energy transfer assays noted PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ self association at concentrations as low as 0.05 mole percent, with divalent and trivalent metal ions, in model membranes and liposomes [@doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2018.04.048].

### How do divalent cations grow and stabilize clusters?
The finite and well-defined size of PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ clusters suggests there is a balance between the mutual electrostatic and steric repulsion of the negatively charged lipids and the attraction mediated by Ca^2+^.
A key piece of evidence is the observation from molecular dynamics simulations that a single Ca^2+^ ion is able to bring together groupings of up to three lipids and lead to changes in membrane packing (as detailed in a publication currently under review).
In simulations, we find that only Ca^2+^ has the ability to nucleate clusters; in experiments, clusters are detected only at higher concentrations of Mg^2+^ and not at all with the monovalent ions Na^+^ or K^+^ [@doi:10.1021/bi9007879]. 

Building upon an automated toolchain for constructing heterogeneous membrane compositions for molecular simulations [@tag:biophysgit; @tag:biophyscode], I will construct and run simulations of PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ clusters.
As in my previous work, I will test several variables independently by varying the counterion species, counterion concentration, and presence or absence of proteins.

### What are the physical properties of the clusters?
That the clusters so far visualized in experiments are round suggests the domains are fluid, rather than crystalline.
- Diffusion is very slow.
- Induction of pores or local regions of high curvature.
- What is the Gaussian curvature?
- What is the modulus of elasticity?
- What is the equivalent radius of curvature?
- Match AFM or scattering experiments.

### How does the ability of PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ to bind proteins change when it is present in a cluster?
I am going to test the hypothesis that PtdIns(4,5)*P*~2~ clusters can form even in the absence of proteins.
